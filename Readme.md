# Sequence - Collaboratively Editable Object Sequences

This is intended to be a general purpose component of CollabKit, enabling a variety of media and data objects to be added, removed and arranged collaboratively in real-time.

Sequence has two primary components:

1. ``seq.Flow`` + ``seq.Block``<br>Fluid drag-n-drop user interface for arranging objects in a sequence
2. ``seq.Transaction``<br>Operational transformation to support real-time collaboration for adding/removing/arranging
